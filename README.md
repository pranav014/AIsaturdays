# DQN-Atari-Tensorflow

Reimplementing "Human-Level Control Through Deep Reinforcement Learning" in Tensorflow

This may be the simplest implementation of DQN to play Atari Games.

## Prerequsite

1. Tensorflow (prefer with GPU CUDA supported)
2. opencv2
3. gym -toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms. ( https://https://github.com/openai/gym )
4. Keras

## Setup and Run

```
git clone https://github.com/pranav014/AIsaturdays.git
cd DQN-Atari-Tensorflow
python AtariDQN.py

```
